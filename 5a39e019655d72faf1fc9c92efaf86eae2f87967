      "message": "Imo the relevant thing is \"camera works\", not sure why the API level is relevant. This is not about \"you can\u0027t make HAL x work anyway if the device was made with HAL y\", but about an enforcement I just don\u0027t understand. If, in theory, someone makes another HAL work with his device than stock, why should he be prevented from doing so via this charter entry?",
