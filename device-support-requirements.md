Welcome to the LineageOS Device Support Requirements. This document enumerates the requirements that must be met in order for devices to be deemed ship ready for LineageOS releases, beginning with Android Oreo.
To be considered ready, device maintainers MUST meet the requirements presented in this document, including any documents incorporated via reference.

The use of “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” is per the IETF standard defined in RFC2119.

# Exceptions

All currently granted exceptions should be listed in the following table. To request an exception, please submit a change to this repository.

| Date       | Device/OEM         | Section Exempted               | Reason |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| 2018/02/08 | Samsung            | Hardware Encryption            | Samsung devices that cannot support hardware encryption due to Knox/Tee are exempted from the hardware crypto requirements. MUST still support software crypto.                                                                  
| 2018/02/11 | Android TV devices | In-Remote Microphones          | Requires proprietary audio routing/methods that have no OSS counterpart, and rely on proprietary functions. MUST support Microphone input through the Android TV Remote app.|
| 2018/02/12 | hlte[can/tmo/usc/vzw] | NFC                         | Stock NFC HAL is undocumented and doesn't match any known interfaces. Stealing configs and firmware from devices with a proper setup fails due to a signature mismatch when the (required) firmware download is attempted. |
