Welcome to the LineageOS Device Support Requirements. This document enumerates the requirements that must be met in order for devices to be deemed ship ready for LineageOS releases, beginning with Android Oreo.
To be considered ready, device maintainers MUST meet the requirements presented in this document, including any documents incorporated via reference.

The use of “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” is per the IETF standard defined in RFC2119.

## Proprietary files extraction

* Devices MUST have a working proprietary files extraction script in their device tree (or device tree dependencies) that reproduces an exact copy of the binaries required to build LineageOS from an existing LineageOS installation.
* Devices SHOULD use the global extraction script (located in vendor/lineage).
* If a device maintainer elects to not use the common extraction script, the maintainer MUST ensure that the Wiki page for their device has valid instructions for operating the custom extraction script.
* Devices MUST use proprietary files extracted from, in order of preference, the same device's publicly-released image, another device's publicly-released image, or some other source with appropriately transferrable use/release/dissemination rights. In the event of the last option, artifacts documenting suitable transferability of rights MUST be provided to LineageOS project leadership.
* All proprietary files lists MUST contain a short comment noting the source of any un-pinned (default) proprietary files.
* Any proprietary files not sourced from the noted default MUST be pinned in the respective proprietary files list and have a short comment noting the source of those proprietary files.

## CVE

* Devices MUST support CVE patches for “high profile” exploits and vulnerabilities (if the media is reporting on it, then we must have it patched).
* Devices SHOULD receive regular CVE patches to the device kernel and dependencies.

## Firmware

* All devices MUST assert on known to be working firmware versions if some firmware versions are known to be non-working.
* A/B devices are exempted from the above rule, and instead must do one of the following:
** If the device is capable of shipping firmware it MUST do so.
** If the device is not capable of shipping firmware (eg. a device with multiple variants supported in one build) the device MUST ensure both slots are on a known good firmware (eg. using the copy-partitions before_lineage_install template on the Wiki).

## exFAT Support

__LineageOS operates under the assumption that OEM device licensing for exFAT is attached to the device, not software. LineageOS will comply with all requests for removal of exFAT support from OEMs, Microsoft or their representatives upon contact to legal@lineageos.org.__

* All devices with exFAT support on stock MAY support exFAT with (and only with) a kernel based implementation.
* All devices without exFAT support on stock MUST NOT support exFAT.

## Additional Features

* All devices SHOULD support in-kernel (MDSS, MDNIE or similar) LiveDisplay colour adjustment.

## Software Deviations

__Software deviations are defined as exemptions granted for software requirements above that worked in stock, but do not work in LineageOS.__

* All software deviations from other LineageOS devices of the same type MUST be approved by Directors (eg. if one wants to remove Music app, get approval).
* All software deviations from other LineageOS devices of the same type MUST be reported on the Wiki page for the device, with a user understandable justification.
* Device maintainers MUST ship Jelly or another LineageOS sourced web browser.

## Vendor Images
* All non-A/B devices relying on an OEM provided vendor partition must assert vendor image versions at flash-time.
* All A/B devices with a vendor partition MUST either:
  * Build a vendor image.
  * Detail on the Wiki: The required firmware version, the process of installing it, and a process that ensures all slots are on the same firmware (eg. the Wiki's copy-partitions template).
* All maintainers MUST NOT require a modified prebuilt vendor image either in their build tree, or on the Wiki.
* All Treble enabled devices SHOULD verify basic hardware functionality with an AOSP GSI.

# Quality of life
## Commit Authorship

* All non-original commits MUST have proper authorship attribution from the source it was taken from or adapted from.

## Copyrights

* All original contributions MUST be copyrighted as “(C) [YEAR] The LineageOS Project”.
* All LineageOS copyrights MUST only be additive to the copyright header.
* Do not remove copyrights from CyanogenMod, Cyanogen Inc or any other upstream.

## Workflow

* Force pushing branches SHOULD be avoided.
* In the event of a force pushed branch, backup branches of the pre-forced HEAD MUST be made.

## GitLab Issues

* Device maintainer(s) MUST have a GitLab account for bug tracking and cross-team collaboration.
* Device maintainer(s) MUST routinely triage, answer and close bug reports.
* Device maintainer(s) SHOULD make their GitLab name match their maintainer name as displayed on the Wiki.

## Licensing

* The device MUST NOT have abnormal battery drain.

## Recovery

* Maintainers MUST document for users on the Wiki a valid Recovery image by which to install LineageOS zip files.
* Devices that do not have traditional Recovery images MUST support & document another means of installation for LineageOS zip files.
* Maintainers wishing to ship LineageOS 17.0+ for their device MUST verify official Lineage Recovery distributions work for LineageOS installation.
* Maintainers SHOULD ship Lineage recovery as the default solution for their device on the Wiki, though may provide TWRP, or any valid recovery image so long as they have valid installation instructions on the Wiki.
* Maintainers SHOULD verify that Teamwin Recovery Project (TWRP) official distributions work for LineageOS installation.
* Failures in official TWRP recoveries SHOULD be raised with the TWRP team or remedied by the maintainer.

# Exceptions

All currently granted exceptions should be listed in the following table. To request an exception, please submit a change to this repository.

| Date       | Device/OEM         | Section Exempted               | Reason |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| 2018/02/08 | Samsung            | Hardware Encryption            | Samsung devices that cannot support hardware encryption due to Knox/Tee are exempted from the hardware crypto requirements. MUST still support software crypto. |
| 2018/02/11 | Android TV devices | In-Remote Microphones          | Requires proprietary audio routing/methods that have no OSS counterpart, and rely on proprietary functions. MUST support Microphone input through the Android TV Remote app.|
| 2018/02/12 | hlte[can/tmo/usc/vzw] | NFC                         | Stock NFC HAL is undocumented and doesn't match any known interfaces. Stealing configs and firmware from devices with a proper setup fails due to a signature mismatch when the (required) firmware download is attempted. |
| 2019/10/21 | s3ve3g.            | NFC                         | Stock NFC HAL is undocumented and doesn't match any known interfaces. Stealing configs and firmware from devices with a proper setup fails due to a signature mismatch when the (required) firmware download is attempted. |
