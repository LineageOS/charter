As LineageOS Project Directors, we:

* Commit to working among ourselves and contributors with professionalism and respect - providing well reasoned arguments for any policy decision made. 
* Commit to establishing project goals and execution plan.
* Commit to ensuring a safe and productive working environment for our contributors - adhering to the Code of Conduct. 

## Our Rules:

    * Device or software deviations/exceptions from our core product must be approved by no less than 3 Project Directors (see LineageOS Device support requirements).
    * Items of significant controversy or substantial change from prior project precedent will require a super-majority of 6 out of 9 Directors in favor.
        * Project Directors will decide what issues constitute the need for this measure prior to discussion on it. 
        * For items requiring a super-majority, contributors will have an open response period where they may share their opinions and thoughts on the matter in a medium moderated by Project Directors. 
2. For items of legal consequence, that is direct or indirect legal and/or financial exposure to the project, veto power is reserved for LineageOS LLC owners. 
3. For items of technical nature and not covered by the above rules, prior to Directors vote, we allow input on the topic from the contributors with domain knowledge/expertise.
4. Decisions made by Directors, if contributor facing, MUST be communicated by the following mechanism:

    * A blog post, wiki update, or other artifact for public consumption of the decision.
6. Directors may step down on their own at any point they wish. 
    * A replacement for departing Directors will be voted on by existing Directors, after soliciting feedback and recommendations from the contributor pool.
    * Replacement Directors should be evaluated on a meritocracy basis and ability to commit the time necessary to fulfill the role.
